This repo is broken at the moment.

I started with a new angular CLI project: 

    ng new electronAngularBoilerplate

Then I tried to follow the directions at this blog post:

    https://auth0.com/blog/2015/12/15/create-a-desktop-app-with-angular-2-and-electron/
    
With these exceptions:

1. my webpack.config.js has these entries as I believe angular2 has been renamed:

    '@angular/core',
    '@angular/router',
    '@angular/common',
    '@angular/compiler',
    '@angular/platform-browser',
    '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic'

2. angularCLI uses 'main' as it's file, so electron's main file is called `electron_main.js`

3. In wepback.config.js, I made the build directory be `electron_build` to avoid confusion.

Note: According to the tutorial, electron and angular need seperate package.json files. the one in the project root is my angular one, the electron package.json is under `./src`

Currently working:

`ng serve` works fine 
`npm run watch` works fine (see scripts or the tutorial for the webpack command)


Current errors:

These:

    electron .
    electron ./electron_build
    electron ./src
    electron ./src/app

produce this error block:

    Error opening app
    The app provided is not a valid Electron app, please read the docs on how to write one:
    https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/v1.1.1/docs

Running `npm run electron` produces this error:
